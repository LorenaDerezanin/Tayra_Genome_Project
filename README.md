# Genomic variation in mustelids - Tayra (_Eira barbara_) genome project

This repo represents a collection of scripts for genome assembly, phylogenomics and genomic variation assessment in mustelids, accompanying the manuscript **Dere≈æanin et al.(2022)"Multiple types of genomic variation contribute to adaptive traits in the mustelid subfamily Guloninae"** and sequencing data available under the NCBI Project ID: PRJNA732552.
Manuscript currently under revision (*Molecular Ecology*), preprint available at [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.461651).
