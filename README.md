# Genomic variation in mustelids - Tayra (_Eira barbara_) genome project

This repo represents a collection of scripts for genome assembly, phylogenomics and genomic variation assessment in mustelids, accompanying the manuscript **"Multiple types of genomic variation contribute to adaptive traits in the mustelid subfamily Guloninae"**.
