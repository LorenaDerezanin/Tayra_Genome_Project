### Code associated with the phylogenomics of mustelids.

*alignLoci.Rscript* - Build alignments and exclude likely mis-aligned regions and regions with likely substituion saturation and excessive missing data. Also reconstructs gene-trees from the final alignments.

*collect.adequacy.saturation.Rscript* - Collect results from tests of model-adequacy and saturation at the level of whole-loci.

*collectTreesAstralAdeq.Rscript* - Reconstruct species trees using acceptable gene trees and a concatenated alignment of gene regions.

*prepareDating_al.Rscript* - Prepare data for molecular dating. See the dating_ad folder for more details on input settings and running script.
